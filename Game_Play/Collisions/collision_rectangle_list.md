collision_rectangle_list
========================

Warning: This script is obsolete! GameMaker now has a function with the
same name that works similarly to this script and has more features.
This script has been removed from the GMLscripts.com index and only 
appears here for historical purposes.

Note: Don't forget to destroy the returned list when you are done with it,
otherwise you'll have a memory leak.
