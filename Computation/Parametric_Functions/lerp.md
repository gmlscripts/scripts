Computes the linear interpolation between two given values.

> [Wikipedia]:  Linear interpolation is often used to fill the gaps in a

> 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000, and that you want to estimate the population
> in 1994. Linear interpolation gives you an easy way to do this.

> operation. e.g. "[Bresenham's algorithm] lerps incrementally between the
> two endpoints of the line."
