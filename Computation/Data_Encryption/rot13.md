rot13
=====

ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar substitution cipher with a 13-position
shift. It is self-inverse, meaning that when a ciphertext produced by ROT13
is passed through it again, the original plaintext is recreated. Only letters
in the English alphabet are transformed; all others pass through unchanged.

Note: ROT13 isn't designed to be secure. It's intended to hide text that can
be revealed simply. It has a long history of use among graybeards who haunt
bulletin boards, Usenet, and internet forums.
