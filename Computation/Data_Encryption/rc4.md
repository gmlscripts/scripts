rc4
===

RC4 is a very fast and very effective variable-key-size stream cipher. This
is a self-inverse algorithm meaning that if you encrypt the plaintext with 
a given key, applying the same key to the ciphertext will reproduce the 
original plaintext. RC4 was developed in 1987 by Ron Rivest and is a trademark 
of RSA Data Security, Inc. It was a trade secret until a compatible algorithm 
was anonymously posted on the internet in 1994. The common generic names for 
the algorithm are ARC4 and ARCFOUR. 

Warning: This script is NOT SUITABLE FOR GM:STUDIO. Because GM:Studio
strings are null terminated, there is a very high chance that the encrypted
strings generated by this script will be truncated resulting in data loss. 
The script must be modified to perform its actions using a different data 
type. Buffers are the recommended type for arbitrary binary data such as 
that produced by this script.
