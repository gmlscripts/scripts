vigenere_cipher
===============

This is based on the classic Vigenère cipher. Using a repeating key, the 
letters in the target text are shifted in the alphabet by varying amounts. 
While effective, this is not a strong encryption. A determined person would
likely be able to crack it. The cipher becomes more effective as the length
of the key increases. The biggest weakness with Vigenère ciphers is in cases 
where many spaces or zero-value characters exist in the source data. When 
that happens the enciphering key can be exposed. Using long keys which appear 
random can help hide the exposure.

Warning: This script is NOT SUITABLE FOR GM:STUDIO. Because GM:Studio 
strings are null terminated, there is a very high chance that the encrypted
strings generated by this script will be truncated resulting in data loss. 
The script must be modified to perform its actions using a different data 
type. Buffers are the recommended type for arbitrary binary data such as 
that produced by this script. Alternatively, you may wish to try 
[vigenere_ascii], although it may have other problems caused by GM:Studio's
string handling.
