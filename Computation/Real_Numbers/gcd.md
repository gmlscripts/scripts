gcd
====

Returns the [greatest common divisor] of the given integers.

_Wikipedia:_
> \(\operatorname{gcd}(54,24)\)
>
> The number 54 can be expressed as a product of two integers in several different ways:
>
> \(54\times 1=27\times 2=18\times 3=9\times 6.\)
>
> Thus the complete list of divisors of 54 is: \(1,2,3,6,9,18,27,54\)
>
> Similarly, the divisors of 24 are: \(1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24\)
>
> The numbers that these two lists have in common are the common divisors of 54 and 24, that is: \(1,2,3,6\)
>
> Of these, the greatest common divisor is 6.
