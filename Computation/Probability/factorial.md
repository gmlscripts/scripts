factorial
=========

Computes and returns the factorial \(n!\) for a given number \(n\).

$$n! = n \times (n-1) \times \cdots \times 1$$

Note: \(18!\) is the largest factorial GameMaker can precisely compute.
It may appear to produce correct results up to \(22!\) but computations
using them are dubious and precision decreases as they get larger.
