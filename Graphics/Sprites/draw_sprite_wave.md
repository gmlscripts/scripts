draw_sprite_wave
================

Draws a sprite with wave-like distortion. A wave can be horizontal or
vertical and its wavelength, anplitude, and phase can be adjusted for
various effects including animation.

NOTE: This is a relatively expensive function compared to drawing a sprite
normally. If it is needed for a large number of sprites, a shader-based
alternative may be preferred.

demo: draw_sprite_wave 320 320
Use sliders and button to adjust effect.
