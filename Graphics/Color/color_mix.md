color_mix
=========

Note: As inline code this is three times as fast as Game Maker's more
flexible [merge_color()] function. However, due to unavoidable overhead,
it is significantly slower when used as a script. In most cases,
`merge_color()` is the better option and this script is presented here
mainly for educational purposes.
