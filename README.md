GMLscripts.com scripts for GameMaker Studio
===========================================

This is the main repository of scripts hosted by GMLscripts.com.

Guidelines for contributing
---------------------------

1. Please try to keep your pull requests small, ideally limited to files
   for one script. If a script requires helper scripts to function they
   should be included. This isn't a strict rule. It's just nice if a pull
   request can be merged without cherry picking. Multiple scripts are OK
   but be sensible with your commits. Don't commit everything at once.
2. Do not delete obsolete scripts from the library. Raise an issue instead.
   Obsolete scripts are handled differently and their descriptive .md
   files have a note placed at the top indicating they are obsolete. The
   reason they are kept in the repo is to keep old web links functioning.
   This will change in the future but this is the way the site works now.
3. The [submission guidelines][1] of the GMLscripts.com site also apply here.
