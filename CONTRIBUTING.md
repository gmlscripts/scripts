Contributing Guidelines
=======================

1. Please try to keep your pull requests small, ideally limited to files
   for one script function. If a script function requires helper functions
   to work, they should be included. Multiple unrelated scripts functions
   are OK but be sensible with your commits. Don't commit everything at once.

2. Do not delete obsolete functions from the library. Raise an issue instead.
   Obsolete functions are handled differently and their descriptive Markdown
   files have a note placed at the top indicating they are obsolete. The
   reason they are kept in the repo is to keep old web links functioning.
   The script section of the site is generated directly from this repo.

3. Please try to adhere to the [style guide] found in the root of this
   repository.

4. Please do not submit code you did not personally create or code that was
   generated by AI and LLM tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot. By submitting
   code to the [GMLscripts.com] script repository, you agree to the terms
   of the [collective license]. You retain the copyright of any your code.
