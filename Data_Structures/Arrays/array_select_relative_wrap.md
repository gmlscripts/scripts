array_select_relative_wrap
==========================

Returns an array element in a position relative to a given value. This is useful
for sequentially selecting values from a list based on a current value.

    //  Move forwards {+1} through a list of colors
    color = select_relative_wrap(color, +1, [c_red, c_orange, c_yellow, c_green, c_blue]);

In the above example, if the current value of `color` is `c_orange`, then its new value
would be set to the next value in the list, `c_yellow`.

    //  Or move backwards {-1} through a list of colors
    color = select_relative_wrap(color, -1, [c_red, c_orange, c_yellow, c_green, c_blue]);

If a relative position is beyond the range of given choices, the position "wraps around"
to the other end of the list. In the second example, if the current value of `color` is
`c_red`, then its new value would be set to `c_blue`.

If the current value isn't among the choices, the returned value is undefined.
