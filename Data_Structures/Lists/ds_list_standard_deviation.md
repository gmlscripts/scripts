[Wikipedia]:

> In statistics, the **standard deviation (SD)** (represented by the Greek 
> letter sigma, σ) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of 
> variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A low standard deviation 
> indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean (also 
> called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation 
> indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.

$$sx=\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma{x^2}-n\bar{x}^2}{n-1}}
\qquad \small \Sigma{x^2}=x_1^2+x_2^2+\dots+x_n^2
\qquad \bar{x}=\frac{\Sigma{x}}{n}
\qquad \Sigma{x}=x_1+x_2+\dots+x_n$$
