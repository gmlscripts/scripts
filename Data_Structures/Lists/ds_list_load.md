ds_list_load
============

Note: This script has been deprecated and removed from the index.
It appears here for historical purposes only.

Note: This script is made somewhat redundant by the addition of 
native functions `ds_list_read()` and `ds_list_write()`,
although this script works differently. For the interchange of
human-readable lists, native functions `json_encode()` and
`json_decode()` are more robust and are compatible with many
existing tools.

script: ds_list_load.gml
